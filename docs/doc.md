### **Full Documentation for BookKeeper Repository**  
**GitHub Repository:** [ytheg/Bookkeeper](https://github.com/ytheg/Bookkeeper.git)  

---

#### **1. Overview**  
**BookKeeper** is a double-entry bookkeeping system integrated with a modular database management system (DBMS) and a terminal user interface (TUI). Designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind, it adheres to the KISS principle and supports features like cryptocurrency wallet integration (non-custodial), schema compilation, and error logging. The project is actively developed in C and targets users seeking a customizable framework for financial tracking or database management .  

---

#### **2. Key Features**    
- **Double-Entry Accounting**: Tracks debits and credits with precision.  
- **Custom DBMS**: Built from scratch using AI Stevens' database design principles, supporting CRUD operations.  
- **Terminal User Interface (TUI)**: Powered by `ncurses` and `panel` libraries for an intuitive text-based interface.  
- **Non-Custodial Wallet Integration**: Under development for cryptocurrency management.  
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for adding concurrency, networking, NLP, and security features.  

---

#### **3. Installation**  
**Prerequisites**:  
- GCC compiler  
- `ncurses` and `panel` libraries  
- `make`  

**Steps**:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ytheg/Bookkeeper.git  
   cd Bookkeeper  
   ```  
2. Compile the project:  
   ```bash  
   make  
   ```  
   This generates three executables:  
   - `ddl_compiler`: Compiles `.sch` schema files.  
   - `dbinit`: Initializes the database directory.  
   - `bookkeeper`: Main program.  
3. Create and initialize the database:  
   ```bash  
   mkdir /path/to/database  
   ./dbinit /path/to/database  
   ```  
4. Run the program:  
   ```bash  
   ./bookkeeper /path/to/database  
   ```  

---

#### **4. Usage Guide**  
- **Schema Files**: Define database structures using `.sch` files, compiled by `ddl_compiler` .  
- **TUI Operations**:  
  - Navigate menus using keyboard inputs.  
  - Perform CRUD operations on financial entries.  
  - View dynamic table presentations of data.  
- **Error Logging**: Check `logfile.c/h` for debugging and error tracking.
